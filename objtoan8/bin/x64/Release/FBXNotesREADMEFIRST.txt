Note that I cannot include the redistributable for the FBX SDK unfortunately due to their odd license.  

The version I have been using is (use the x64 version):
C:\Program Files\Autodesk\FBX\FBX SDK\2014.1\lib\vs2008\x64\release\libfbxsdk.dll

Put it in the same folder.

Get it here:
http://images.autodesk.com/adsk/files/fbx20141_fbxsdk_vs2008_win.exe

It should install that dll and copy it over.
