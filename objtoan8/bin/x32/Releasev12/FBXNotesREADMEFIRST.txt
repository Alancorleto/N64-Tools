Note that I cannot include the redistributable for the FBX SDK unfortunately due to their odd license.  

The version I have been using is:
C:\Program Files\Autodesk\FBX\FBX SDK\2020.0.1\lib\vs2013\x86\releaselibfbxsdk.dll

Put it in the same folder.

Get it here:
https://www.autodesk.com/content/dam/autodesk/www/adn/fbx/2020-0-1/fbx202001_fbxsdk_vs2013_win.exe

It should install that dll and copy it over.
